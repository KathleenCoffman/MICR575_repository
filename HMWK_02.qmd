#__Homework assignment two__  
1. __What were the main issues in the Reinhard and Rogoff issue, and how best could they have been avoided?__  _The main issues here in this situation involved a few different things. One issue was their obvious excel error. Another problem is that their data was not publicly accessible when their findings were published._  
_These issues could have been avoided by having others check their codes and findings and excel sheets several times. They also should have included their raw data and excel file when their inital publication became available._  
2. __What key attributes make a piece of data analysis reproducible? Please put those attributes in a prioritized list (i.e., for you, what is most important, next  most important, etc.__  
+_Annotated codes are incredibly important to ensure reproducability!_  
+_Making raw data and excel files publicly accessible upon publication review_  
+_Keep detailed notes that directly correspond to your data_  
+_Making sure excel file columns and headers have sensible titles_  
3. __Imagine that you are doing a piece of data analysis that only you will ever see perhaps you are shopping for a car and trying to determine what will give you the best value for your money. Should you think about making your data analysis reproducible? Why or why not?__  
_No matter what data analysis I do, I think it is important to make data available to other and to make it reproducable.  
Why? Because reproducible data is helpful to those out there wondering the same thing. If I am look for the best value for my money regarding car shopping, it is practically guarunteed that many others are assessing the same thing. To contribute to hte greater good of finding the best value for money, I would definitely think about making my data reproducible._

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
